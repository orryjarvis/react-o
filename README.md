# react-o

This is intended to be an incubator repository for my own React snippets, recipes, ideas (I won't guarantee all code is complete :smiley:), and patterns that I have come up with accross projects that I can reflect on, reuse, or flesh out. There is no strict structure-- feel free to use it however you would like. I do necessarily plan to publish, maintain, or document everything; the primary consumer is myself.
